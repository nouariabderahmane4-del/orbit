## 🌞 Overview

Orbit is a **fully interactive, fully customizable 3D model of our Solar System**, built to help kids learn astronomy through hands-on experimentation.

This simulation allows users to:

- Explore planets & moons in 3D  
- Adjust the speed of time  
- Create, edit, or delete planets  
- View scientific info panels  
- Fly a spaceship through the solar system  
- View realistic textures, clouds, atmospheres & rings  
- Hover planets to view quick info  
- Search planets instantly  
- Reset the entire system at any time  

Orbit transforms abstract astronomy ideas into an immersive digital experience.

## 🚀 Features

### 🌞 Realistic Solar System

- Real planet textures (NASA-style look)
- Scaled sizes, distances, and orbital speeds
- Orbit paths for each planet
- The Sun emits light via a Three.js `PointLight`

### 🔄 Time Control (Simulation Speed)

Accessible through the left-side GUI panel:

- **Play / Stop** the simulation  
- **Speed Multiplier** slider (0–5x)  
- All planet & moon motion respects the time scale

### 🛠 CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete Planets

**Create** planets using the *Planet Factory* GUI:

- Name  
- Size  
- Distance from the Sun  
- Color  
- Orbit speed  

**Update** planets through their individual GUI folders:

- Adjust size  
- Move orbital distance  
- Change orbit speed  
- Recolor in real time  

**Delete** planets:

- Every planet except the Sun can be deleted  
- A Reset button restores the default solar system

### 🌑 Moons System

Planets can define moons in the `planetData` file. Each moon:

- Orbits its parent planet  
- Has its own miniature orbit line  
- Uses its own speed and distance  
- Is updated according to the global time scale

Examples include Earth’s Moon, Mars’ moons, and Jupiter’s Galilean moons.

### ☁ Clouds, Atmospheres & Rings

Planets support optional visual enhancements:

- Cloud layers (e.g. Earth)  
- Shader-based glowing atmospheres (e.g. Earth, Venus)  
- Rings (Saturn) built with `RingGeometry`

### 🛰 Camera Interaction & Hover Information

- **Hover** over a planet → A tooltip shows:  
  - Name  
  - Size  
  - Distance from the Sun  

- **Click** a planet → The camera smoothly transitions to a close orbital view and locks onto it.  
- Press **ESC** → Camera returns to a wide “whole system” overview.

### 📚 Detailed Planet Information Panel (HUD)

When a planet is focused, a right-side info panel slides in to show:

- Planet name  
- Descriptive text  
- Temperature  
- Surface gravity  
- Mass  

### 🔎 Planet Search

A search bar at the bottom center lets you type a planet name and jump to it instantly:

- Case-insensitive  
- Ignores extra whitespace  
- Centers the camera on the matching planet

### ✨ 3D Environment & Effects

- Galaxy sky sphere as the background  
- Dense, colorful starfield (10,000+ stars)  
- Smooth orbital camera controls via `OrbitControls`

---

## 🛸 Bonus Feature: Spaceship Game Mode

Orbit includes a bonus “spaceship mode” that turns the simulation into an arcade-style spaceflight experience.

### Enter / Exit Spaceship

- Use the **“ENTER SPACESHIP”** / **“EXIT SPACESHIP”** button in the top bar
- When active, normal orbit controls are disabled and spaceship controls are enabled

### Ship Types

Choose a craft from the **Hangar** modal:

1. **Retro Rocket** — High speed, powerful thrust  
2. **Cyber Speeder** — Balanced speed and handling  
3. **Alien Saucer** — Very agile, drifty handling  

Each ship has its own geometry and physics tuning (speed, acceleration, turn responsiveness, friction).

### Controls

| Key        | Action           |
|-----------|------------------|
| W         | Thrust forward   |
| S         | Brake / reverse  |
| Arrow ↑   | Pitch up         |
| Arrow ↓   | Pitch down       |
| Arrow ←   | Turn left (yaw)  |
| Arrow →   | Turn right (yaw) |

The camera follows behind the ship with a smooth lerped offset for a cinematic feel.

### Core Ideas

- **SceneSetup**  
  Centralizes the Three.js `Scene`, `Camera`, `Renderer`, lights, and galaxy sky sphere.

- **Planet Entity**  
  Encapsulates:
  - Geometry + textures
  - Clouds, atmosphere, rings
  - Orbit path line
  - Moon creation
  - Update loop for rotation & revolution

- **GuiManager**  
  Uses `lil-gui` to:
  - Control global time scale
  - Create/reset planets
  - Provide a folder per planet for live property edits
  - Safely delete planets (except the Sun)

- **InputManager**  
  Handles:
  - Mouse move, click, drag detection
  - Raycasting for hovers/clicks
  - Tooltip display
  - Camera transitions and focus

- **UIManager**  
  Controls the DOM-based HUD:
  - Planet info panel
  - Search bar and query handling

- **Spaceship**  
  Implements a simple physics system with position, velocity, acceleration, and friction, and updates the camera to follow.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://gitea.kood.tech/abderahmanenouari/orbit.git
cd orbit
```

### 2️⃣ Start a local dev server

You can use any simple static server. For example:
